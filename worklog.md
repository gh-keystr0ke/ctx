# ctx worklog

This file is the durable implementation history and hand-off context for the project.

## 2026-08-17 — Project intake

- Read `eng_conclu.md` and `product_conclu.md` as the authoritative engineering and product specifications.
- Confirmed the repository starts empty apart from those two untracked documents and has no prior commits.
- Chose the specification's vertical-slice order: deterministic Rust core, SQLite storage, Git-aware Python indexing, business context, impact/explain, review, bounded context packs, verification, then MCP.
- Preserved the main constraints: local-first, no required LLM or network access, provenance on semantic claims, conservative review findings, and bounded typed traversal.
- Planned to run `cargo fmt --check`, strict Clippy, and the full workspace test suite after every milestone.

### Current state

Implementation has not started. The next milestone is M0: workspace, domain types, migrations, and storage integration tests.
